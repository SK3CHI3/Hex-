## üîß Configuration

### API Configuration
The application uses OpenRouter API to access the DeepSeek R1 model. Configure your API key through the application interface.

### Environment Variables
No environment variables are required for basic functionality. All configuration is handled through the UI.

## üé® Customization

### Themes
The application uses a dark cyberpunk theme with green accents. Colors can be customized in `src/index.css`:

```css
:root {
  --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
  --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
  /* ... other color variables */
}
```

### Presets
Add custom security testing presets by modifying the `PROMPT_PRESETS` object in `src/pages/Index.tsx`.

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All conversations are processed through OpenRouter API
- API keys are stored locally in browser localStorage
- No conversation data is permanently stored on external servers

### Responsible Use
- Always obtain proper authorization before testing
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Comply with local and international laws
- Use only in authorized testing environments
